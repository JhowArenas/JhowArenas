## About

I am a Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience building and evolving systems that operate in complex, global environments. I enjoy working closely with architecture and decision-making, taking strong ownership of solutions that need to be reliable, scalable, and aligned with real business needs.

Over the years, I have led and shaped critical engineering initiatives, including the architecture of global payment systems for Visa. This work involved payment gateways, anti-fraud engines, and core services responsible for processing highly sensitive financial data at scale. I also led the engineering and enablement of a full TikTok Shop connector, which became a strategic revenue driver and an important asset for client retention and acquisition.

My main technical focus is on Node.js, React, and JavaScript/TypeScript, with solid experience across ASP.NET, PHP, MySQL, SQL Server, and MongoDB. I adapt quickly to new challenges and enjoy environments that require thoughtful architecture, continuous learning, and clear technical ownership from design to delivery.

As a Software Engineer, I stay hands-on and close to the code, while contributing to architectural decisions, system reliability, and long-term scalability. I work closely with engineering teams to raise technical standards and ensure resilient, secure systems. I am certified on the VTEX e-commerce platform and am currently pursuing Shopify certification, reinforcing my focus on modern commerce ecosystems at scale.
